# PageFaultOptimization

A project focused on simulating and optimizing *Page Replacement Algorithms* in Operating Systems to reduce the number of *page faults. This repository provides implementations and performance comparisons of common algorithms like **FIFO, **LRU, and **Optimal Page Replacement*.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To understand and analyze the efficiency of various page replacement algorithms by simulating memory access patterns and measuring page faults.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented
- *FIFO (First-In-First-Out)*
- *LRU (Least Recently Used)*
- *Optimal Page Replacement*

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Simulates page reference strings with different frame sizes
- Counts and compares the number of page faults
- User-defined input for page sequence and frame size
- Clean and modular code structure

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Requirements
- Python 3.x (for script-based simulation)  
OR  
- C++ compiler (if implemented in C++)

### Run (Python Example)
```bash
python page_fault_simulation.py
